# Code_Samples
This is a repository of various tools, analyses, and experiments that I have conducted in a professional setting. These examples will certainly **not** be the most efficient or impressive way to program, but they were not meant to be. They were meant to help me learn how to program, explore theoretical concepts in-depth, and conduct analyses very quickly and iteratively. They allowed me to efficiently test a large number of scenarios and thus return to my clients or coworkers with confident answers!

There are a couple of python files (".ipynb" extensions) which deal more with process control theory -- Bode plots, "ideal" PID tuning, simulations using transfer functions and differential equations. Once you click on one of those, you can download them or open them in Binder (will probably want to do this if you don't already have the Controls python library installed). Binder will create a virtual environment and let you make changes and see the new outputs live!

I've also compiled a [GitHub Pages website](https://cmh-sample.github.io/Code_Samples/) for hosting R markdown files. The ".Rmd" files will show you their source codes  **(Todo: Add Shiny Dashboard, possible python scripts here as well)**

So with that said, please email me with any questions or interests you may have. Thanks for visiting!
