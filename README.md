# Code_Samples
This is a repository of various tools, analyses, and experiments that I have conducted in a professional setting. These examples will certainly **not** be the most efficient or impressive way to program, but they were not meant to be. They were meant to help me learn how to program, explore theoretical concepts in-depth, and conduct analyses very quickly and iteratively. They allowed me to efficiently test a large number of scenarios and thus return to my clients or coworkers with confident answers!

There are a couple of python files (".ipynb" extensions) which tend to deal more with process control theory -- Bode Plots, "ideal" PID tuning, simulations using transfer functions and differential equations. I've also compiled a [GitHub Pages website](https://github.com/cmh-sample/Code_Samples) for hosting R markdown files. The ".RMD" files will show you their source codes  **(Todo: Add Shiny Dashboard, possible python scripts here as well)**

So with that said, please email me with any questions or interests you may have. Thanks for visiting!
