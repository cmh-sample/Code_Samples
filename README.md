# Code_Samples
This is a repository of various tools, analyses, and experiments that I have conducted in a professional setting. These examples will certainly **not** be the most efficient or impressive way to program, but they were not meant to be. They were meant to help me learn how to program, explore theoretical concepts in-depth, and conduct analyses very quickly and iteratively. They allowed me to efficiently test a large number of scenarios and thus return to my clients or coworkers with confident answers!

So with that said, please email me with any questions or interests you may have. Thanks for visiting!
